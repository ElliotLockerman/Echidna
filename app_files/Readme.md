# app_files/

This folder contains some extra files that `Echidna.app` needs. Some are included in at compile time, some are copied in to the app bundle for use at run time.

None of them are dependencies as far as `cargo` is concerned, so if you change one and don't see the results you expect, a `cargo clean` may help.
